This is a vignette for the Freekfoofactors package. It shows you how to use the package. Here is another sentence.

Load the package.
```{r}
library(Freekfoofactors)
```


This doesn't work well
```{r}
x <- c("a", "b")
x_fact <- factor(x)
y <- c("c", "d")
```

This does.
```{r}
fbind(x_fact, y)
```

Thank you for your attention.
